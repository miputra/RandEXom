**What is RandEXom?**

RandEXom is a C# randomisation utility library to give more controllable randomization parameter. There are so many ways you can do to do randomizing in programming, and RandEXom trying to archieve those methods in a single library, either by using an already made algorithm or a new algorithm, so we can do randomizing with whatever method we want.

## How to use

Note: Every IDE has a different way to add .dll as a reference. 

If you use the visual studio on your project:

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your project, then click add reference
2. On the bottom left window, click the browser button, and choose RandEXom.dll
3. Now you can using RandEXom library in your project
